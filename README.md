#BASH SCRIPT
# AWS Server Management Scripts for API Deployment

This repository contains Bash scripts for monitoring, maintaining, and backing up an API deployed on an AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance (t2.micro or t3.micro). These scripts support automation of server health checks, backups, and update processes.

---

## ðŸ”§ Scripts Overview

### 1. `health_check.sh`
**Purpose:**  
Monitors system health and ensures the API is operational.

**Functionality:**
- Checks CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space.
- Verifies that the web server (Apache/Nginx) is running.
- Sends `curl` requests to `/students` and `/subjects` endpoints and checks for HTTP 200 response.
- Logs results with timestamps to `/var/log/server_health.log`.
- Adds warnings to the log if disk space is <10% or an endpoint is unreachable.

---

### 2. `backup_api.sh`
**Purpose:**  
Creates daily backups of the API code and database.

**Functionality:**
- Archives the API directory (e.g., `/var/www/your_api`) into `/home/ubuntu/backups/api_backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz`.
- Dumps the database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) into `/home/ubuntu/backups/db_backup_$(date +%F).sql`.
- Deletes backup files older than 7 days.
- Logs backup results to `/var/log/backup.log`.

---

### 3. `update_server.sh`
**Purpose:**  
Automates server updates and API deployment from GitHub.

**Functionality:**
- Updates system packages (`apt update && apt upgrade -y`).
- Pulls the latest API changes from GitHub.
- Restarts the web server.
- Logs the process to `/var/log/update.log`.
- If `git pull` fails, logs the error and skips the restart.
